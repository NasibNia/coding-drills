two times

here is how:

We can divide the coins into three sections:
ooo   ooo  oo

first we compare the 3-coin sections against each other: there are two possible cases:

- if one is lighter; then we know the fake coin is in that section; so we go for another round of weighting: we compare the weight of any two arbitrary coins: again two possible cases:
    1) if one is lighter; that is our fake coin  ---> problem solved
    2) if they have the same weight, the third one is the fake one! ---> problem solved
- if the two have the same weight , that means the fake one is in the other section, one of the two remaining ones:
    -we can simply wight the two against each other and find the lighter one ----> Problem solved!
