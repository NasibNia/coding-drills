One time weighting could work.

if we put all the satcks in line and label them as shown above, then choose different numbers of coins from each, and put them all on the scale , after that we can confidently say which of the original bags contain the conterfiet. here is how:

we have 55 coins on the scale (1+2+...+10 = 55);
if they all were authentic the weight would be 550 grams.
Although the wieght would be more than that. the diference in the wight is the same as the bag label.
for example if the weight is 557, we know we have extra 1 grams; meaning we have 7 coins that are fake and since we know which bag we took 7 coins from we have found the conterfeit bag!!!!
