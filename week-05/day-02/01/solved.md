first of all; who has classes late at night?!!!

couple of different scenarios:

***************** Scenario 1 **********************
Robert is the tallest, so it's best if he holds the flash light. he + another one starts passing and once reaching the middle of the bridge stays there while the other one keeps going. he has to stand in the in the middle of bridge, and holds the flash light with his arm straight up so he can lighten the bridge in both ways. 

Once the first person reaches the other end, the other two passes while robert is still at the middle of bridge: then the other three pass one by one. Finally robert waits for the forth one to reach him and passes the other half of the bridge with him.

---------Robert----------> 10
Ricky  
---------Robert----------> 2
Jerom  
---------Robert----------> 1

If the bridge is not that long and the flashlight can lighten up the whole bridge while standing at one side Robert could pass the whole bridge at first round and do keeps the light for the rest, this will save them even more time

sasha  
-------------------> Robert 10
Ricky + jerome  
-------------------> Robert 2

***************** Scenario 2 **********************
If they can find a way to throw the flash light across the bridge the can make it in 12 minutes, this is technically similar to the Scenario 1 , part b


sasha + Robert 
-------------------> 10

Ricky + jerome 
-------------------> 2

***************** Scenario 3 **********************

if none of this is an option and they must cross the bridge in the conventional way; two passing and one getting back bringing back the flash light to take the next person ; then The earliest they can make is 19 minutes unless they leave Ricky behind! 


sasha + jerome 
-------------------> 10

jerome
<------------------- 1

Robert + jerome 
-------------------> 5

jerome
<------------------- 1

Ricky + jerome 
-------------------> 2
