[Ep. 50 - The Pragmatic Programmer Part I](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/the-pragmatic-programmer-i)
>Dave Thomas has done a lot for the programming community. He coined the phrase “DRY” (Don’t Repeat Yourself). He popularized the idea of code katas. He was one of the signers of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, and he's the founder of the Pragmatic Bookshelf publishing company. But despite all that, he refers to himself as simply a programmer. In this episode, he shares his own coding journey, gives advice to new developers on how to navigate the mountain of information available, and how he ended up becoming a publisher.

>In part two of our interview with Dave Thomas, we dive into some of his other contributions to the community, including coining the phrase “DRY” (Don’t Repeat Yourself), popularizing the code kata, and signing the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. We explore the impacts of these contributions, particularly to code newbie community.


[Ep. 93 - Storytelling with Code](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/storytelling-with-code)
>Michael Rau didn’t want to build an app, he wanted to create an experience. So he constructed a physical room, and with the help of a Rails app, created a theater show called “Temping.” He talks through his concept, how he used his new coding skills to make it happen, and the surprising emotional reactions he’s witnessed from audience members who’ve tried his creation.

[Ep. 82 - What Is Code?](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-is-code)
>Paul Ford didn’t expect his article on coding to go big. But almost a year later, the Bloomberg issue dedicated to “What is code?” is still completely sold out. We dig into the major topics covered in that long and highly entertaining piece, like conferences, open source, and languages, and how Paul and the editors created a technical article that still managed to be accessible to coder and non-coders alike.

[Unstoppable Learning](https://www.npr.org/2013/04/25/179010396/unstoppable-learning?showDate=2013-05-03)
>May 3, 2013 • Why do we put so much effort in making kids think and act like us? In this hour, TED speakers explore the different ways babies and children learn — from the womb, to the playground, to the web.
